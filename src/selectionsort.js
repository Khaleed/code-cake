/**
 * Finds the smallest unsorted element and adds it to the end of a sorted list.
 *
 * Time Complexity in worst case is 0(n^2) since we have to iterate
 * over each of the n elements in of the list to find the smallest unsorted elements
 * and repeat this process n times as only one element gets sorted on each pass.
 *
 * Time complexity in best case is Î©(n^2) since there is no gurantee the list is sorted
 * until we go through the process n times for each element (until we actually run selection sort).
 *
 * Space Complexity is constant at O(1) because we are pushing smallest element to sorted array
 * which is a constant operation.
